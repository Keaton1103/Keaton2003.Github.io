Project Description
I call my project "Mountain High Hamburgers"and we wanted to show how much people love mountain high and its amazing food. On yelp it was rated 4.7 out of 5, and on facebook it was rated also 4.7 out of 5. Mountain high has been around for along time, it stays so famous by its homemade recipes and wonderful service. Mountain High Is right of exit 70 so if u are evr on the road stop by to get yourself a hamburger,milshake, or fries.
